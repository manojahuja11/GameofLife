# GameofLife

I have included all the unity project files. 

To view the game, you either have to download this whole repository and run it from Unity software, or go to builds folder and run Life.exe on Windows Computer.

To make it simple, Initinally, You do not have to place the live cells manually, the live cells will be generated randomly, so everytime you restart the game you will have different outputs.
